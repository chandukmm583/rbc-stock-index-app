# rbc-stock-index-app
This applicaiton is used to hold repo for RBC interview coding exercise.

Highlights:

1) Used Controller advice for exception handling for all classes at a central place.
2) All requirements defined in Document implemented .
3) Due to time constraint did not write unit tests, but I would strongly recomend to atleast cover 70% with units. 
4) Swagger enabled with Spring Doc Open API for easier testing.
5) Models, Services, Repositories, Exceptions are well seperated and defined in their own packages.
6) Used H2 to avoid dependence on external database for easier testing.
7) Used cucumber for Smoke tests, Due to time constraint I could not implement all senarios but will extend to cover all senarios to build regression suite.
